/**
 * This class handles an abstraction of SQL statements used by TOra to extract
 * information and manipulate data. This is useful in two ways, first off you
 * can edit the strings using a handy editor inside TOra if you find bugs. Also
 * you can use different statements for different Oracle versions. You can also
 * add support for new versions of Oracle without any need for recompilation or
 * programming knowledge.
 *
 * All information about SQL statements are stored in one global static map which
 * contains a name, a description and one or several statements connected to one
 * Oracle version.
 *
 * To determine which SQL to use the statement with the highest
 * version not above the current connection is used. If no statements below or
 * equal to the current version is available the lowest available is used.
 *
 * Versions are compared as strings to a version string returned by database
 * such as "1102000100". Therefore version of SQL should be specified in a
 * similar format (usually skipping a "patch" part). For example: 0801, 0902
 * or 1102.
 *
 * All strings are specific for a given database provider. No attempt to use
 * strings from other providers will be made.
