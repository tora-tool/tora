QSscintilla port:

* More integrated QScintilla features (toMarkedText class)
    The toMarkedText class is still using its own version of the search/replace 
    functionality from the pre-QScintilla times. Since QextScintilla has powerful 
    search mechanism (regex support etc) - this needs to be integrated and the old 
    one got rid of.

  - fix insert(str, select). see toMarkedText::insert

* Finish implementation of syntax colouring editor component (toHighlightedText class)
    Code completion in SQL editor (using QextScintillaAPIs class), better integration 
    with lexer class (QextScintillaLexer). We also probably need to override 
    QextScintillaLexerSQL to better suit TOra purposes.
    
* Subtask from previous - integrate toSyntaxAnalyzer with QextScintillaLexer (or our 
    subclass of it). This is needed to because toSyntaxAnalyzer used all over TOra to 
    do validity checks of SQL, parameter parsing and other related things (not just 
    syntax colouring). Hence it would make much more sense to integrate it with 
    QextScintillaLexer where the latter can take keyword lists out of toSyntaxAnalyzer.
    
* Syntax colouring configuration options (toSyntaxSetup class and UI dialog) 
    This has to be reimplemented to use QextScintillaLexer class instead of toSyntaxAnalyzer. 
    
* PL/SQL debugging (toDebugText class)
    This has to be updated to use marker facilities provided by QextScintilla
